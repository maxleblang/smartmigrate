# SmartMigrate NextJS Frontend

## Setup
### 1. Install npm and NodeJS
In order to run the frontent of SmartMigrate, you'll need to use NodeJs and either `npm` or `yarn`. This walkthrough using `npm` but the setup is very similar for `yarn`. Install instructions for Node and `npm` can be found [here.](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

Verify that everything was successful by running
```
node -v
npm -v
```

### 2. Install all needed packages
Next, install all the needed packages for the app by running
```
npm i
```

If you run into any errors during installation, run `npm i --force` (maybe this isn't the best way but its a solution for now).

### 3. Run the app
Now you should be all good to go. Simply run
```
npm run dev
```
to start the app on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Happy developing!
